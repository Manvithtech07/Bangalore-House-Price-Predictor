## Overview

This project is an end-to-end data science solution. It involves collecting and cleaning a raw dataset of over 13,000 property listings, performing in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), and engineering new features to improve model accuracy. The final result is a tuned XGBoost regression model that is deployed as a user-friendly web application using Flask.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to build a reliable regression model that can accurately estimate a property's value based on its key features, such as:
* Location
* Total Square Footage
* Number of Bedrooms (BHK)
* Number of Bathrooms

## Tech Stack

* **Data Science:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
* **Web Framework:** Flask
* **Deployment:** Render
